#Create a HTML page which includes the following:-
# - An input area to take a number input
# - A button that calls a function called “increment”
# - The initial result shown would be undefined
# - A function called “increment” which increments the number input by the user from input in “a”
# - A display area that displays the “incremented” value of the input

# NOTE:
# 1. The initial result should be undefined
# 2. The initial increment should show the output as the number input.
# 3. Once the initial result is cleared with the increment value, the increment value should use the existing result.

# Code here
